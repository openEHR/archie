    There is no clear agreement on exactly where the chest circumference should be measured. In cases where this is important to the interpretation of the results, this should be documented in the 'Method' element.
    
    Use to record change from repeated measurements. This can currently be modeled by constraining the 'any event' to an interval in a template with an associated mathematical function, as appropriate.
    
    This archetype can also be used for recording an approximation of the chest circumference measurement in a clinical scenario where it is not possible to measure an accurate chest circumference - for example, measuring an uncooperative child. This is not modelled explicitly in the archetype as the openEHR Reference model allows the attribute of Approximation for any Quantity data type. At implementation, for example, an application user interface could allow clinicians to select an appropriately labelled check box adjacent to the 'chest circumference' data field to indicate that the recorded chest circumference is an approximation, rather than actual.">

    Not to be used to record the circumference of another body part. Use OBSERVATION.body_segment in these circumstances except where more specific archetypes exist such as OBSERVATION.hip_circumference.">
