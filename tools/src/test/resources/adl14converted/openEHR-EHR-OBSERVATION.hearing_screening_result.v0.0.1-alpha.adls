    Use to record the outcome of all responses to hearing screening (or Screening Outcome). 
    
    This archetype has been designed to capture screening assessment for hearing, using pass/fail criteria, for the following tests:
    - Pure Tone Audiometry;
    - Play Audiometry;
    - Automated Auditory Brainstem Response; and
    - Visual Reinforcement Orientation Audiometry.
    
    All of the data elements are recorded using a single method or protocol. If, during the test, any of the protocol parameters need to be modified, then the subsequent part of the test will need to be recorded within a separate instance of the test data, using the updated protocol parameters.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used for hearing threshold assessment - use the OBSERVATION.audiogram archetype.
    
    Not to be used to record other auditory assessments such as:
    - Behavioural Observation Audiometry (BOA);
    - Most Comfortable Listening Level (MCL) and Uncomfortable Listening Level (UCL);
    - Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) for diagnostic purposes
    - Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE); and
    - Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE).
    These assessments need to be recorded in specific archetypes for the purpose.">
