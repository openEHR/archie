Progress notes are more typically used to record ongoing care notes by various providers participating in aspects of care during some kind of healthcare episode, as distinct from a one-off face-to-face meeting in a clinic which is typically recorded as a COMPOSITION.encounter. A progress note may not include a face-to-face meeting between a clinician and the subject, but may be used to record health information remotely from the patient or report on a follow-up telephone conversation or liaison between healthcare providers without the subject present.
    
    A typical nursing progress note during a hospital episode might include EVALUATION.reason_for_encounter, EVALUATION.progress_note to record the narrative summary of the nursing shift, a combination of OBSERVATIONS for recording vital signs measurements and/or ACTIONS to record the tasks or procedures carried out.">
