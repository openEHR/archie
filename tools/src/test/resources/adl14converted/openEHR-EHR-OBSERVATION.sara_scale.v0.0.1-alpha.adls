            purpose = <"SARA is a clinical scale that is based on a semiquantitative assessment of cerebellar ataxia on an impairment level. SARA has 8 items that are related to gait, stance, sitting, speech, finger-chase test, nose-finger test, fast alternating movements and heel-shin test. Although the cerebellum is directly involved in the coordination of eye movements, oculomotor functions are not considered, as the validation trials indicated that they are determined by other factors than appendicular and midline ataxia. SARA underwent a rigorous validation procedure involving three large multi-center trials in SCA and non-SCA ataxia patients, as well as controls.">

            use = <"Assessment of cerebellar ataxia on an impairment level for patients with Ataxia.
    Depending on the disease stage, its administration takes 5–40 min (mean 14.2 min) and does not require special
    training or technical equipment (Schmitz-H€ubsch et al. 2006). The eight measuring items were selected from a
    standard neurological examination for their specificity for ataxia and their qualities of standardizing testing and rating procedures. A maximum score of 40 reflects most severe ataxia. The items are the following: gait (score 0 to 8), stance (score 0 to 6), sitting (score 0 to 4), speech disturbance (score 0 to 6), finger chase (score 0 to 4), nose-finger test (score 0 to 4), fast alternating hand movements (score 0 to 4), and heelshin slide (score 0 to 4). Testing of limb function is rated independently for both sides. The arithmetic mean of both sides is considered for sum scores.">
