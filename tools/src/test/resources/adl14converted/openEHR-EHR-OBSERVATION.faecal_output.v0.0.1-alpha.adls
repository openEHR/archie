    This archetype can be used to record details about:
    - each single bowel motion, including episodes of diarrhoea; or
    - the total faecal output over a specified period of time, for example the amount of diarrhoea as art of a fluid balance chart over an 8 hour nursing shift.
    
    Each measurement should be recorded using a separate instance of this archetype.
    
    If an individual has diarrhoea, a fluid balance chart may require inclusion of this archetype alongside multiple instances of OBSERVATION.fluid_output and OBSERVATION.fluid_input archetype to capture all of the various inputs and outputs, plus a single instance of the OBSERVATION.fluid_balance to record the overall fluid status.">
