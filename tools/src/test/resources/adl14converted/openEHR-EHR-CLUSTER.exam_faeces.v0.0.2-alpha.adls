    This archetype has been designed to be used within:
    - the 'Examination findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.exam and related CLUSTER archetypes; 
    - the OBSERVATION.faecal_output to describe the diarrhoea being measured; or
    - the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test to describe physical properties about a faecal sample/specimen. 
    
    It can also be used within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.
    
    The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.
    
    Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
            misuse = <"Not to be used for recording measurements of faecal output - use OBSERVATION.faecal_output for this purpose.
    
    Not to be used for recording the clinical history about bowel habits - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom.">
