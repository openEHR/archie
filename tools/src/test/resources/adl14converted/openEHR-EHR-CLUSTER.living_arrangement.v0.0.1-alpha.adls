    The intent of this archetype is to provide a sense of the level of day-to-day support, both physically and emotionally, that may be available to an individual in their 'home' setting.
    
    The concepts around housing, accommodation and living arrangements are complex and often potentially overlapping. Within this archetype, the intent of the concept of 'household' is to capture information about the group of people (one or more) who live in the same dwelling and share meals or living accommodation. A single dwelling may be considered to contain multiple households if either meals or living space are not shared. In this context households can include varieties of blended families, share housing, group homes, boarding houses, and a single room occupancy.
    
    This archetype has been designed to be used within the EVALUATION.housing_summary archetype, but may be used within any other appropriate ENTRY or CLUSTER archetype related to recording social context.">
