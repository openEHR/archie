    This archetype has been designed to record the examination findings of sputum being observed.
    It is assumed that the option to record whether sputum is present/absent or if a cough is productive/unproductive will be captured in the relevant parent archetype.
    
    This archetype has been designed to be used within:
    - the 'Examination findings' SLOT in the OBSERVATION.exam and related CLUSTER archetypes; 
    - the OBSERVATION.fluid_output to describe the sputum being measured; or
    - the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test to desctibe physical properties about a sputum sample/specimen. 
    
    It can also be used within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.">
