    This archetype has been designed to be a framework that will be adequate for ordering or requesting a simple informed consent, but allow for additional details to be optionally added within the 'Details' SLOT to meet the specific requirements of a more complex clinical scenario.  For example, additional consent details can be included using the CLUSTER.consent_details archetype. Other archetypes can be developed and optionally included in the same SLOT for the purpose of including specific details about the procedure, trial or activity.">
