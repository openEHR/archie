    The NSRAS is designed to allow the assessment of neonates at risk of skin breakdown or pressure sore development, based on the Braden Scale for predicting Pressure Sore Risk in adults.
    
    It should be noted that although the purpose of the scale is similar to that of the adult Braden Scale and Braden-Q scale for older children, the scoring methodology is completely different, particuarly that a high score is accociated with high risk, the opposite from these other Braden scales where a low score equates to high risk.">
