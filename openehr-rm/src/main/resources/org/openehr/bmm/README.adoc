# specifications-ITS-BMM

BMM schemas for use with openEHR systems and tools. The repository is structured as follows:

----
/original				# BMMs from original openEHR, prior to separated components
/example				# BMM containing documentation on format with examples
/components
	/BASE				# BMMs for BASE component
		/Release-1.0.0 		# BMMs for Release-1.0.0 of BASE
		/etc
		/latest			# BMMs for working version of BASE
	/LANG				# BMMs for LANG component
		/Release-1.0.0 		# BMMs for Release-1.0.0 of LANG
		/etc
		/latest			# BMMs for working version of LANG
	/RM				# BMMs for RM component
		/Release-1.0.3 		# BMMs for Release-1.0.3 of RM
		/Release-1.0.4 		# BMMs for Release-1.0.4 of RM
		/etc
		/latest			# BMMs for working version of RM
	/PROC				# BMMs for PROC component
		/Release-1.0.0 		# BMMs for Release-1.0.0 of PROC
		/etc
		/latest			# BMMs for working version of PROC
/adl_test/

To use these files in tools, the recommended approach is to point the tool to the `components` (or `original`, if using Release 1.0.2) directory of a clone checkout area, and to manage a table of files identified by schema id (determined by meta-data inside the files), and to resolve the include references via this table.
