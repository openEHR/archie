The archetype is intended to capture blood pressure measurements in all clinical scenarios - for example, self-measurement with a home blood pressure machine; an emergency assessment of systolic using palpation and a sphygmomanometer; measurements taken in clinical consultations or during exercise stress testing; and a series of measurements made by a machine in Intensive Care.
    There is a rich state model that supports interpretation of measurements through identifying patient position, exercise, confounding factors and angle of a tilt table in research.
    Named events have been limited to average over a 24 hour period, however templates can further constrain the default 'any event' to cater for specific requirements for blood pressure measurements such as recording Blood Pressure against specific points in time, or over a range of intervals (+/- mathematical functions).">
