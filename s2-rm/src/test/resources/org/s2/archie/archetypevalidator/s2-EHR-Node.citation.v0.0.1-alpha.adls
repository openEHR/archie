For example, a discharge summary may include the summary report of a laboratory test through the use of this citation archetype, rather than duplicating the whole laboratory report.
            This archetype is deliberately designed as a Node class archetype so that the citation can be made via insertion into a slot within the context of other archetypes, or as a standalone instance within the specific EVALUATION.citation archetype.">
