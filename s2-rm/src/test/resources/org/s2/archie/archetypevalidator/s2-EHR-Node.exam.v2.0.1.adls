            This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam or the \\\"Procedure detail\\\" SLOT within the ACTION.procedure archetype, but can also be used within other ENTRY or Node archetypes, where clinically appropriate. Specialisations of this archetype can be used to record examination findings for identified body systems or anatomical structures. If there is no appropriate specialisation available, use this archetype and identify the system or structure being examined using the 'System or structure examined' data Node and the location on the body using the 'Body site' data Node or the 'Structured body site' SLOT.

            Interpretation of the findings, for example 'No abnormality detected' or 'Moderate inflammation present', can be recorded using the 'Clinical interpretation' data Node.

            Use to provide a framework in which Node archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings.

            The Node.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

            Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data Node.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and Node archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and Node.symptom_sign.

            Not to be used for recording the results of an imaging examination - use the Node.imaging_exam family of archetypes for this purpose.">
