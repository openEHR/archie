			use = <"Use to record the Body Mass Index of both adults and children.
            
            Use to enter the Body Mass Index either manually (ie calculated and directly entered by the clinician), or automatically (ie calculation and entry is done automatically by a software application, based on separate height and weight measurements).
            
            Formulas: Body Mass Index is commonly calculated as weight (kg) / [height (m) squared]. This is the assumed formula unless otherwise specified in the Formula Node within Protocol. Alternatively estimate Body Mass Index using pounds and inches: weight (lb) / [height (in) squared] x 703 (with ounces (oz) and fractions changed to decimal values).
            
            In some situations the Body Mass Index formula is corrected eg for use in amputees - this specific formula can be recorded as part of the protocol.  Alternatively the common Body Mass Index calculation can be used with amputees and similar injuries or disabilities if using adjusted height and/or adjusted weight, as appropriate, rather than actual height and weight.   See openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.height-adjusted and openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.body_weight-adjusted.
            
            See WHO reference re adjusting height/length for Body Mass Index in paediatrics. 
            
            In children and teens, BMI needs to be assessed using age-related reference charts.">
