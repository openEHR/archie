			use = <"Use to record information about a specific adverse reaction event caused by exposure to a specific substance. The substance may be recorded in the 'Specific substance' Node in this archetype, or in an appropriate Node in the parent archetype in which this archetype is nested.

            This archetype is designed to be nested within the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk or the OBSERVATION.adverse_reaction_monitoring archetypes, to record details about a specific reaction event, but it could also be nested within other archetypes where clinically appropriate.

            The scope of this archetype has deliberately focused on identifying a pragmatic data set that are used in most clinical systems or will be suitable for most common clinical scenarios; however, it permits extension of the model when additional detail is required, using the 'Reaction details', 'Exposure details', and 'Reporting details' slots. An extension may be required if a specialist allergist or immunologist needed to record a more detailed assessment as part of a report to regulatory bodies or within the context of a clinical trial.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record adverse events, including failures of clinical process, interventions or products. For example: abnormal use or mistakes/errors made in maladministration of an agent or substance; incorrect dosage; mislabelling; harm or injury caused by an intervention or procedure; overdose/poisoning etc. Use a specific archetype for this purpose.">
