            Not to be used for recording another type of measurement, such as pulse rate, where the recording device also provides this. This should be recorded in a separate archetype, appropriate for that particular measurement to allow consistent querying. In this example, record the pulse rate in the OBSERVATION.pulse archetype.
            
            Not to be used to record any peripheral blood gas measurement that involves direct contact with blood. For example, PaO₂, PaCO₂ should be recorded using the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result archetype.
            
            Not to be used to record invasive blood gas measurement. For example, arterial (SaO₂), venous (SvO₂) oxygen saturation or Oxygen content (CaOC) which are usually determined by invasive methods such as laboratory blood gases or vascular catheter devices. These should also be recorded within the OBSERVATION.laboratory_test_result archetype.">
