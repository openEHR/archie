					The archetype is intended to capture heart rate measurements in all clinical scenarios - for example:
    				- self-measurement with a home blood pressure machine;
    				- a heart rate captured while using a pulse oximeter:
    				There is a rich state model that supports interpretation of measurements through identifying patient position, exercise, confounding factors and angle of a tilt table in research.">
